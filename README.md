OpenAssistant Chatbot - Streamlit Deployment with Hugging Face Integration

Welcome to the OpenAssistant Chatbot repository! This project showcases the implementation of a sophisticated chatbot powered by the Large Language Model (LLM) - OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b. The chatbot is designed to engage in natural and meaningful conversations, making it a powerful tool for various applications.

Key Features:

State-of-the-Art Model: The heart of this chatbot is the OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b model, a cutting-edge Large Language Model that enables the chatbot to understand and generate human-like text responses.

Streamlit Deployment: We've integrated the chatbot with Streamlit, a user-friendly Python library for creating interactive web applications. With Streamlit, users can effortlessly engage with the chatbot through a clean and intuitive interface.

Impressive Accuracy: Our chatbot has undergone rigorous training to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. The OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b model's capabilities contribute to its ability to handle a wide array of user inputs effectively.

Downloadable Conversations: At the end of each chat session, users have the convenience of downloading the entire conversation in a .txt format. This feature is particularly useful for archiving discussions or referring back to the conversation history.

Hugging Face's Hug Library: The chat functionality is powered by the Hugging Face's Hug library, a toolkit that simplifies the process of integrating language models into applications. This library ensures seamless communication between the chatbot and users.
